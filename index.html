    <div class="title">Rough Action Plan
    </div>
    <div style="height:45px"></div>
    <div class="step">The discord examples above aren't there because they're successful.
        <br>
        <br>
        They're there because we think this is truly an accurate representation of what you can get working with us.
        <br>
        <br>
        We go a step further than anyone else you'll find. And that is because we can truly customize whatever you'd
        like
        in your discord.
        <br>
        <br>
        A quick example of getting the discord up and online would be...
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1. Implementing a verification system</b>
        <div class="instructions">
            Making sure that users are safe and aren't being a target of Spam/Phishing messages is very important to us.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>2. Giving interactivity to end-users. (Custom Roles, features, ect.)</b>
        <div class="instructions">
            In our builds, we like to give users their choice of what they can interact with. Whether that's giving them
            a menu to choose their roles, or other customization options.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example) let's say someone wants to get alerts from Alex Hormozi's twitter. They can choose to interact
            with the role and then they get notifications in the discord whenever he posts.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Implementing a moderation API. Explicit content by end-users is automatically removed.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            Example: Someone says something against the guidelines. The person is automatically muted and their message
            deleted.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Styling the Discord</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            We're here to give the Mozi Nation something that's unique and stands out from the rest.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>5. Automated ticket system</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            Say for example someone had a question about something. They could make a ticket and we'd configure it to be
            only available to select people to view. Such as the Mozi nation moderators. They can then help that user
            privately and resolve their issue quickly. We can also create all past tickets into transcripts to be viewed
            at any time.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>6. Server Customizations</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            When it comes to server setting customizations, you can expect the Mozi Nation to be fitted out to the Max.
            From giving Alex a blue checkmark next to his name in the discord to enabling the discord to search
            discovery, there's much we can do.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>7. Whatever you want!</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            We're being serious. If you want something in there, we can add it. I'm a developer that deals with custom
            API and bots.
        </div>
        <div class="title">About Your Goal</div>
        <div class="step">
            If your goal is to create a community for conversations and releasing exclusive free content. <b> Consider
                it done and more.</b>
        </div>
