    <div class="title">Rough Action Plan
    </div>
    <div style="height:45px"></div>
    <div class="step">The discord examples above aren't there because they're successful.
        <br>
        <br>
        They're there because we think this is truly an accurate representation of what you can get working with us.
        <br>
        <br>
        We go a step further than anyone else you'll find. And that is because we can truly customize whatever you'd
        like
        in your discord.
        <br>
        <br>
        A quick example of getting the discord up and online would be...
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1. Implementing a verification system</b>
        <div class="instructions">
            Making sure that users are safe and aren't being a target of Spam/Phishing messages is very important to us.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>2. Giving interactivity to end-users. (Custom Roles, features, ect.)</b>
        <div class="instructions">
            In our builds, we like to give users their choice of what they can interact with. Whether that's giving them
            a menu to choose their roles, or other customization options.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example) let's say someone wants to get alerts from Person X's twitter. They can choose to interact
            with the role and then they get notifications in the discord whenever they post.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3. Implementing a moderation API. Explicit content by end-users is automatically removed.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            Example: Someone says something against the guidelines. The person is automatically muted and their message
            deleted.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Styling the Discord</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            We've given plenty of communities something that's unique and stands out from the rest.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>5. Automated ticket system</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            Say for example someone had a question about something. They could make a ticket and we'd configure it to be
            only available to select people to view. Such as moderators. They can then help that user
            privately and resolve their issue quickly. We can also create all past tickets into transcripts to be viewed
            at any time.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>6. Server Customizations</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            When it comes to server setting customizations, you can expect your server to be fitted out to the Max.
            From giving a blue checkmark next to your name in the discord to enabling the discord to search
            discovery, there's much we can do.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>7. Whatever you want!</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="instructions">
            We're being serious. If you want something in there, we can add it. I'm a developer that deals with custom
            API and bots.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Don't Miss Out</div>
        <div class="step">
            Some of the most popular discord communities out there have been built by us. We're not always available, so
            feel free to contact us sooner than later!
